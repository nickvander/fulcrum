## Future / Strategic

- [ ] Mercado Pago Checkout API integration — research in
      `work/future/mercadopago-checkout-research.md`.
- [ ] Rust backend migration first slice — plan in
      `work/future/81-rust-backend-migration-plan.md`.
- [ ] AI content generation (product descriptions, marketing copy) —
      plan in `work/future/ai-content-generation.md`.
- [ ] Phase 8 Advanced Analytics — ETL pipeline, cost engine,
      interactive charts, alerting. Plan in
      `work/future/80-advanced-analytics.md`.

## Done This Past Week

- [x] Customer onboarding checklist + launch readiness report.
- [x] Supplier document import review queue (incl. AI catalog parsing
      with vendor auto-link).
- [x] Marketplace allocation workflow (stock-transfer model + ML Full
      API).
- [x] OAuth token refresh hardening (401-retry + reauth chip on
      stock-transfer sync panel).
- [x] Low-stock dashboard widget + shopping-cart reorder.
- [x] Demo workspace + cleanup guardrail.
- [x] AI catalog import (CSV + PDF + image), gated on configured key.
- [x] Reusable `report_export` module + 7 reports × CSV + PDF.
- [x] Named CSV import templates ("Map & Template" UX).
- [x] Inventory adjustment audit log UI (`/products/audit`).
- [x] All 5 disabled product-form specs unblocked; frontend 450/0
      skipped.
- [x] AmazonAdapter SP-API completion — `sync_inventory` (PATCH with
      required `marketplaceIds`, MFN `fulfillment_availability`,
      propagates 401 for the retry wrapper) and `fetch_orders` (GET
      `/orders/v0/orders` with `MarketplaceIds`+`CreatedAfter`/
      `NextToken` pagination). Shipped in `d669246`.
- [x] Stockout / velocity / margin reports — three new CSV + PDF
      exports on `endpoints/reports.py` sharing one SalesOrderItem
      aggregation pass. Velocity ranks every product by daily sales;
      margin shows revenue/cost/gross/margin%; stockout is
      velocity-based (out / imminent / watch) distinct from threshold-
      based low-stock. 13 backend tests.
- [x] Marketplace channel cards: reauth chip — implementation was
      already shipped in `7b682c0` (chip state + reconnect button on
      the card). Added 13 frontend tests covering state precedence,
      tooltip with/without reason, and DOM rendering of the chip +
      warn-styled Reconnect button.
- [x] Reports UI for velocity / margin / stockout — new
      `analytics-reports-widget` on the dashboard, with a window
      selector (30/60/90/180d) and CSV + PDF buttons per report.
      Backed by `AnalyticsReportsService` and the shared
      `ReportDownloadService`. 14 new frontend tests (6 service + 8
      widget); endpoints verified live via auth+curl (CSVs return
      real data, PDFs start with %PDF-1.4).
- [x] Margin report: historical cost-at-sale — migration
      `5d9f2a3b1c08` adds `sales_order_items.cost_per_unit`. ML
      webhook and Amazon ingestion now snapshot
      `Product.cost_price` at order-create time. Margin SQL uses
      `SUM(quantity * COALESCE(items.cost_per_unit, products.cost_price))`
      so the report stops drifting on new rows while legacy NULL
      rows still render. 5 new backend tests cover the captured
      path, the legacy fallback, the mixed case, and the
      ingestion-time snapshot for orphan items (NULL).
- [x] Frontend alert-rule management UI — new `/alerts` page in the
      sidenav: Material table of rules with per-row Test / Edit /
      Delete + enabled toggle. Create/Edit dialog with type select,
      threshold + window + cooldown + email, threshold hints that
      change per type. Delete uses the shared ConfirmationDialog.
      Test button shows a per-result snackbar (matched + sent /
      matched + not sent / not matched). 16 new frontend tests
      (6 service HTTP + 10 page DOM + CRUD interactions).
      Live-tested all CRUD via curl: list → create x2 → patch
      disable → test (triggered + email sent) → delete x2 → empty.
- [x] Alerting (low margin / sales dips / stockout risk) — Track 3
      Step 6 of `80-advanced-analytics.md`. Per-user `AlertRule` +
      `AlertEvent` schema, three evaluators sharing the same SQL
      helpers as the velocity/margin/stockout reports, email
      notifications via the existing `EmailService` provider
      (console-by-default; SMTP via `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` or
      future channels). Hourly Celery beat task
      `evaluate_alerts`. CRUD API at `/api/v1/alerts/rules` with a
      `/test` endpoint that force-notifies for SMTP-wiring
      verification. Per-rule cooldown prevents notification spam.
      23 new backend tests + live smoke test against the dev
      backend (rule fired, email composed with correct subject +
      HTML, cooldown skip respected on the next tick).
- [x] Amazon order ingestion worker — Celery beat task
      `poll_amazon_orders` runs every 15 minutes per
      MarketplaceCredential. New `services/amazon_order_ingestion.py`
      delta-polls SP-API since `MarketplaceCredential.last_orders_polled_at`,
      upserts SalesOrder + SalesOrderItem keyed by
      (source=AMAZON, external_order_id), decrements local stock
      on new orders (idempotent — re-polls only refresh status/total).
      New `AmazonConnector.fetch_order_items` for SP-API line items.
      Migration adds `last_orders_polled_at` to
      `marketplace_credentials`. 14 backend tests; smoke-tested
      live on the dev backend (orders_new + orders_updated + the
      per-credential failure-isolation contract all verified).
